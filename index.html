            <h1>think every think positive</h1>
            <p>Positive thinking sounds useful on the surface. (Most of us would prefer to be positive rather than
                negative.) But, “positive thinking” is also a soft and fluffy term that is easy to dismiss. In the real
                world, it rarely carries the same weight as words like “work ethic” or “persistence.”</p>
